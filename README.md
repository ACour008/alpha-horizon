# alpha-horizon
A 2D story-driven space combat and trading game in the works. Created with Cocos Creator

##Features at this stage of development:
- A small universe (~36 star systems) but it is procedurally generated.
- Thats about it for now.

##Future developments:
- Travel through 'jump gates'.
- Navigate diplomatic relations of star systems through story events
- Fight space pirates
- Trading system to get cool ships and equipment.
- A (hopefully) immersive story.

##Where are you right now?
- I am creating different game sprites and implementing the design pattern to allow player to travel through the jump gates to different star systems.
- This means prototyping a galatic map, which is like 80% done.
